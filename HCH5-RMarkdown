##5.4

\textbf{An engineer suspects that the surface finish of a metal
part is influenced by the feed rate and the depth of cut. He
selects three feed rates and four depths of cut. He then conducts
a factorial experiment and obtains the following data}

\textbf{(a) Analyze the data and draw conclusions. Use $\alpha$ = 0.05.}

```{r}
library(readxl)
surface <- read_excel("E:/Chapter 5/surface.xlsx")
####
a=3
b=4
n=3
surface.aov = aov(Surface ~ Feed.Rate*Depth, surface)
summary(surface.aov)
```

$H_0: \tau_1 = ... = \tau_a = 0$

$H_1: \tau_i \ne 0$ at least one

$H_0: \beta_1 = ... = \beta_b = 0$

$H_1: \beta_j \ne 0$ at least one

$H_0: (\tau\beta)_{1 1} = ... = (\tau\beta)_{a b} = 0$

$H_1: (\tau\beta)_{ij} \ne 0$ at least one

We analyze the anova and we can see from our p-values that they are all too small. We can state the row, column, and interaction are all significantly different and we can state that this model is significant.

\textbf{(b) Prepare appropriate residual plots and comment on the
modelâ€™s adequacy.}

```{r}
surface.lm=lm(Surface ~ Feed.Rate*Depth,surface)
res=surface$Surface-fitted(surface.lm)
library(car)
qqPlot(res)
plot(fitted(surface.lm), res) 
plot(as.numeric(surface$Feed.Rate), res)
plot(as.numeric(surface$Depth), res)
```

Looking at normality and how the residual behavoirs 

\textbf{(c) Obtain point estimates of the mean surface finish at
each feed rate.}

```{r}

```
